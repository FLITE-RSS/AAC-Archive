# AAC-Archive

This is q quick R-script for archiving a site from sprinshare. 

The default directory to which the archive will be written is set at the top of 'crawlAAC.R.' It is currently set to 'AACDocStore'.

The script will create 1 folder per item on the left-hand menu, containing a screenshot of the site in PNG format, a HTML file of the source, and any \*.docx or \*.pdf files linked on that site. The script is keyed to safe files linked through URLs containing 'content_id.'

Enjoy!
